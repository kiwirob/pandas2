pandas 2.0 Design Documents
===========================

.. note::

  These documents are a work in progress. Please see ongoing discussions on
  http://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas2

These are a set of documents, based on discussions started in December 2015, to
assist with discussions around changes to Python pandas's internal design
intended to better accommodate the evolving needs of the growing Python data
userbase and to help ensure that pandas remains a relevant and important
project in the future.

We also will use this place to collect ideas for things to remove (such as
deprecated features, but possibly other things) from the library that don't
necessarily depend on the internal implementation.
